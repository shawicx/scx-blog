## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Content Migration (Priority: P1)

Users should be able to access the same blog content after the migration without any visible changes to the content itself. The migration should preserve all existing Markdown files and their frontmatter.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without content, there is no blog. This must be completed first before any other work.

**Independent Test**: Content files can be successfully read by Astro and displayed at the same URLs as the original VitePress site.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** original VitePress markdown files in a directory, **When** migration script is run, **Then** equivalent Astro content files are created with the same frontmatter and content
2. **Given** VitePress configuration in .vitepress/, **When** converted to Astro config, **Then** all navigation and metadata are preserved

---

### User Story 2 - Theme Conversion (Priority: P2)

Users should experience the same look and feel after the migration. The new Astro theme should closely match the original VitePress theme.

**Why this priority**: User experience consistency is important for seamless transition.

**Independent Test**: A user visiting the site after migration cannot tell the difference in presentation between the old and new sites.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** VitePress theme and layout, **When** converted to Astro components, **Then** the visual appearance remains consistent
2. **Given** user navigation on the site, **When** using Astro pages, **Then** navigation functions the same as in VitePress

---

### User Story 3 - Cloudflare Integration (Priority: P3)

The system should be deployable to Cloudflare Pages with R2 storage for assets, replacing the current deployment method.

**Why this priority**: Needed for production deployment and efficient asset management.

**Independent Test**: The application builds successfully on Cloudflare Pages and assets are properly served from R2.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Astro project configured for Cloudflare Pages, **When** deployed, **Then** site is accessible and performs well
2. **Given** images and other assets, **When** uploaded to R2, **Then** they are properly referenced and accessible from the site

---

### User Story 4 - Automation and CI/CD (Priority: P4)

The build and deployment process should be automated via GitHub Actions without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Needed for efficient ongoing development and deployment workflow.

**Independent Test**: A commit to the main branch triggers the GitHub Action which builds and deploys the site successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code changes pushed to repository, **When** GitHub Action runs, **Then** site is built and deployed automatically
2. **Given** failed build, **When** GitHub Action runs, **Then** appropriate error notifications are sent

---

### User Story 5 - Testing and Verification (Priority: P5)

The migration should be thoroughly tested to ensure no functionality is lost and performance is maintained or improved.

**Why this priority**: Quality assurance to ensure the migration is successful.

**Independent Test**: A comprehensive test report validates that all functionality works as expected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** migrated site, **When** tested against original VitePress site, **Then** all functionality is equivalent
2. **Given** performance metrics from both versions, **When** compared, **Then** Astro version meets or exceeds performance of VitePress version

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when migrating content with complex VitePress-specific syntax?
- How does the system handle custom VitePress components during migration?
- What if Cloudflare deployment fails due to configuration issues?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST migrate all existing Markdown content from VitePress to Astro format
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve all frontmatter metadata during migration
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate Astro components that replicate the VitePress theme
- **FR-004**: System MUST configure Cloudflare Pages deployment
- **FR-005**: System MUST set up R2 for asset storage
- **FR-006**: System MUST create GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain existing URLs for SEO purposes
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure all links and navigation work correctly after migration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Content Files**: Markdown files with frontmatter that represent blog posts and pages
- **Layout Components**: Astro components that define page structure and styling
- **Configuration**: Astro configuration that replicates VitePress settings
- **Deployment Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds and deployments

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All existing content is accessible at the same URLs after migration
- **SC-002**: Site performance meets or exceeds original VitePress performance metrics
- **SC-003**: Deployment process is fully automated via GitHub Actions
- **SC-004**: 95% of original functionality is preserved after migration
- **SC-005**: Migration task can be completed within 1 week as specified in timeline
